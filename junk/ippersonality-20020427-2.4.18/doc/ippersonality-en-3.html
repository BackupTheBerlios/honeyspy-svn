<P>Considering the above restrictions, we have chosen a solution based on
<EM>netfilter</EM> and <EM>iptables</EM>: the latter provides the
mangle table, designed to enable modifications on packets (contrary to the
filter and nat tables, designed for filtering and address
translation). Consequently, we created the new PERS (as IP
Personality) target, which can rewrite packets in several ways. The
rules let <EM>iptables</EM> select IP packets according to their
source and destination address and port, and the parameters passed to
the PERS target alter its behaviour, which can be tuned by the
administrator to define how a class of packets should be rewritten.

<P>Once installed and configured properly, IP Personality makes it
possible to fool nmap into believing that the host runs an operating
system freely specified by the administrator. Most test packets sent
by nmap are abnormal, and the others are sent to closed ports,
therefore they have no influence on the local TCP/IP stack: consequently
we can divert them without worry, and send the replies that suit to
our needs. The PERS configuration covers a large set of possible
answers, thus we can send back to nmap packets which are specific to
any kind of system described in nmap's OS fingerprint list.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>Some of the operations intended to deceive nmap (not all of them,
though) can also be applied to packets that are routed by the
host. Even though we lose the capacity to completeley lure nmap, our
modifications are efficient enough to prevent it from detecting the OS
running on its target. The operations we can apply to routed packets
are TCP sequence numbers and options rewriting.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>By the way, some rewriting operations can improve robustness in some
cases. In particular, the hosts with weak ISN generators are
vulnerable to sequence number prediction attacks, and they can be
protected by our target, which offers a truly random ISN. Furthermore,
thanks to the versatility offered by the syntax of the  configuration
file, the possibilities for emulation are not limited to existing
network fingerprinting tools: it becomes very easy to fool, or at
least disturb any tool that relies on the same tricks as nmap, since
we can control the elements that make a packet typical.

<P>In order to handle all the possible behaviors of an IP stack, the
configuration is done through an external config file describing
values for several parameters. This file is parsed and loaded in
kernel space with an extension to <EM>netfilter</EM>'s configuration
tool, <EM>iptables</EM>. In particular, for cases difficult to
emulate, that configuration file contains two "code" sections that are
interpreted in the kernel (as pseudo-code) in order to analyse
packets more precisely with algorithms similar to those of the
emulated operating systems.

<P>The PERS target can modifiy the packets it receives from the
<EM>netfilter</EM> architecture. Therefore it is used in the mangle
table, which is meant to enable packet modification.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>This table has access to two of <EM>netfilter</EM>'s hooks,
PRE_ROUTING and LOCAL_OUT. So as to be able to rewrite
connections correctly, the PERS module needs to track each
connection's packets in both directions (we will explain why later).
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>To achieve this, we use a pair of rules configured identically, except
that their source and destination criteria are symmetric. For routed
packets, both rules must be on the PRE_ROUTING hook, since
packets of both directions come from hosts other than the local
machine. By contrast, even though the traffic sent to the local
machine uses the PRE_ROUTING hook, responses are sent via
LOCAL_OUT.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>In every rule used to rewrite a class of traffic, there is an option
to tell the module whether it should protect the source or the
destination of the packet, since some rewriting operations are done
differently depending on the packet's direction.
<P>
<P>
<H3>TCP packets</H3>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>If the packet is sent to the local machine (this is an option of our
target), it is first sent to the decoy generation code: here the
pseudo-code of the tcp_decoy section of the configuration file
decides whether the packet can continue as is, or (if the
packet has been found to be abnormal) whether we have to send back a
decoy based on the packet.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>If the packet continues, it can be modified in different ways. In
particular, the direction, which can be determined with information
provided by <EM>iptable</EM>'s conntrack module and with parameters of
the current rule, defines how the packet is rewritten. The possible
modifications are:
<P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>














<B>sequence numbers rewriting:</B> we want to be able to
simulate initial sequence number generators, and at the same time we
want that steps following the establishment of a connection work
properly. Therefore we need to rewrite the sequence and
acknowledgement numbers in all packets of a connection for which the ISN has
been modified. The first rewriting is done when the ISN is chosen by
one of the generators in PERS (the configuration file defines a
generator and its parameters); at this time, the difference between
the original ISN and the one generated by PERS is saved. As this
difference between the sequence numbers used by both sides remains
constant, we can simply add it to the sequence numbers in one way and
subtract it from acknowledgement numbers in the other way;

</LI>
<LI>







<B>window size rewriting:</B> since the initial window size is a
characteristic element, we want to be able to control it. But as for
sequence numbers, once we have set a limit, we must enforce it for all
the packets of the connection;

</LI>
<LI>












<B>options rewriting:</B> when a connection is established, both IP
stacks exchange useful information by the use of options: they
are optionnal fields in the TCP header, that lie between the regular
header and the payload of the packet. The supported options and the
order in which they appear is a characteristic we can tweak: this is
done by interpreting the pseudo-code from the tcp_options subsection of
the configuration file. This code tests the type and values of options
and the flags of the TCP header, and then builds a new option buffer to
replace the original one.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H3>UDP packets</H3>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>UDP packets that are simply routed are ignored. However, packets for
the local machine are analysed to check if their destination port is
listening: if that's the case, they are left as is; otherwise, they
are dropped and PERS is then responsible for emitting an ICMP Port
Unreachable message packet because nmap will check it.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>This kind of message is made of an IP packet with an ICMP header,
followed by the beginning of the original packet that generated the
message. The configuration file allows one to control each part of the
generated reply packet that nmap uses to identify the OS.
<P>
<P>
<H3>Common part for IP packets</H3>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>After the potential changes in UDP/TCP packets, all IP packets can
also be modified. Right now, only one change can be done : tweaking
the IP ID number using a value generated with a defined method, just
like for the TCP ISN.
