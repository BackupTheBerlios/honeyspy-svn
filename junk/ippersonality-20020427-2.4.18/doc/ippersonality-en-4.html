<P>The configuration of the PERS target is done in userspace with the
<EM>iptables</EM> command and an associated dynamic library for
specific parameters. This library adds new options for setting up the
PERS target; one of the options allows the user to specify a
configuration file containing all the parameters needed to emulate a
particular operating system. Hence by using different
configuration files for each different netfilter rule, one can easily
choose to look like a particular OS for some sources or destination
addresses, for a specific interface, and/or for other matching criterias.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 Command line options</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>Command line options are passed to the target when adding a rule
using it, for instance with a syntax like the following one:
<P>
<P><CODE>iptables -A &lt;chain&gt; -s &lt;source&gt; -d &lt;destination&gt; -j PERS &lt;options&gt;</CODE>
<P>
<P>
<P>[Refer to <EM>iptables</EM> documentation for more information on
the global syntax]
<P>
<P>The following options are recognized by the library:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><EM>-tweak {src|dst}</EM>







: This option sets the way packets should be rewritten for the
corresponding rule. If its value is "src", then it means one wishes to
protect the source of the matching packets (for instance, rewriting
ISNs). If it is set do "dst", then the destination is protected (in
that case acks would be rewritten).</LI>
<LI><EM>-local</EM>





: This option specifies that either the source or the destination
(depending on the value of tweak) is local, and that the "decoy" and
"udp" modules should be enabled for it (if available in the configuration
used) in order to completely fool tools suchs as nmap.</LI>
<LI><EM>-conf</EM> 



<EM>&lt;file&gt;</EM>: This option sets the configuration file to
use for the emulated system in this rule (see below).</LI>

<P>The parameters for emulation of a particular operating system are
specified in the configuration file. This file has a syntax similar
to named.conf, inspired from C. Options are grouped together in logical
blocks (delimited with { and }), each block corresponding to a different
kind of packet rewriting operation. Each option is composed of an identifier
followed by one or more arguments, and ended by a ;.
Options and blocks can be specified in any order.

<P>
<H3>Identification </H3>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>The first item of the configuration file is an identification for the
system being described. It is a string at most 20 characters long. Syntax is as
follows:

<H3>Generic TCP parameters</H3>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>These parameters are grouped together in a block named <EM>tcp</EM>.
Example:
<P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
  tcp {
    incoming yes;
    outgoing no;
    max-window 65536;
  }
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>The <EM>incoming</EM> parameter sets whether you wish to enable
TCP connections modifications (ISN, window size, options) for
incoming connections to the protected zone. It can either be set to
<EM>yes</EM> or <EM>no</EM>.
<P>
<P>
<P>The <EM>outgoing</EM> parameter has the same meaning but for
outgoing connections
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>The <EM>max-window</EM> parameter controls window size rewriting
for TCP packets from connections matching the previous options. If it
is set to a non-null value, then for every new connection with a
window size greater than the given value, an offset is computed and
applied to every packet to set the window size below the specified
value for the length of the connection.
<P>
<H3>Sequence Numbers Generator Parameters</H3>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>These parameters are grouped together in a block named
<EM>tcp_isn</EM>.
Example:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
  tcp_isn {
    type random-inc 10000;
    initial-value 2600;
  }
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>The <EM>type</EM> parameter sets the type of generator to emulate
and possible options for it. The following types are supported:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><EM>fixed-inc &lt;number&gt;</EM>






: That's the simplest generator. The initial sequence number
is simply increased of a fixed value (specified as
argument) at each new connection. Using 0 as the increment value
allows one to emulated systems using fixed initial sequence numbers.</LI>
<LI><EM>random-inc &lt;number&gt;</EM>






: That's a pseudo-random generator. For each new connection, the
initial sequence number is incremented by a random value chosen
between 0 and the specified number. This is the kind of generator used
on systems such as Linux, FreeBSD, ... The strength of such a
generator is determined by its random range.</LI>
<LI><EM>true-random</EM>




: This is a truly random generator. For each new connection, the
initial sequence number is randomly chosen using the kernel's
internal entropy based random generator.</LI>
<LI><EM>builtin</EM>



: This is the host system builtin generator. Hence under linux, it
is a random incremented generator.</LI>
<LI><EM>time-dep &lt;number&gt;</EM>







: This is a time dependant generator. The passes number specifies
the frequency of the generator (in Hz). For instance, using 25000 for
the value allows one to implement the generator
recommended in RFC 793: the ISN is then incremented by 1 every 4
micro-seconds. (however, the generator granularity depends on the host
system ticks precision, 100 Hz by default on linux/x86)</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>The <EM>initial-value</EM> sets the initial value to use for the
emulated generator. A numeric value can be specified or
<EM>random</EM> which will pick this number randomly when loading the
rule. This parameter is of little importance on strong generators.
<P>
<P>
<H3>IP ID Generator Parameters</H3>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>These parameters are grouped together in a block named
<EM>ip_id</EM>.
Example:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
  ip_id {
    type broken-inc 1;
    initial-value 2600;
  }
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>The <EM>type</EM> parameter sets the type of generator to emulate
and possible options for it. The same types as for the ISN generator
are available, with an additional one, <EM>broken-inc
number</EM>: it is an incremented counter of the specified value, but
the result is saved in the packet in little endian order instead of
network order.
<P>
<H3>Options Reordering Parameters</H3>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>These parameters are grouped together in a block named
<EM>tcp_options</EM>.
Example:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
  tcp_options {
    keep-unknown yes;
    keep-unused no;
    isolated-packets yes;
    timestamp-scale 100;
    code {
      &lt;code...>

</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>This block defines how TCP options of a packet should be
rewritten. The <EM>code</EM> subsection contains a simple program
written in a langage close to C (see below), which is compiled by the
<EM>libipt_PERS.so</EM> module. This code is passed to the
virtual machine that fills an option buffer (part of its state) as it
runs it. When the execution is over, the new options buffer is used to
replace the original options buffer of the packet.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>The <EM>keep-unknown</EM> parameter specifies if "unknown" options
in the original packet (hence that can't be handled in the code)
should be added at the end of the new options buffer so they are
kept. It can be set to either <EM>yes</EM> or <EM>no</EM>.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>The <EM>keep-unused</EM> parameter specifies if options from the
original packet that haven't been used (probed or copied) by the code
should be added at the end of the new options buffer so they are
kept. It can be set to either <EM>yes</EM> or <EM>no</EM>. This allows
one to use a very simple code to reorder a few options while keeping
the other ones functionnal.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>The <EM>isolated-packets</EM> parameter specifies if options
reordering should be performed for packets that do not belong to any
known connection. It can be set to either <EM>yes</EM> or
<EM>no</EM>. (defaults to no).
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>The <EM>timestamp-scale</EM> parameter specifies if the timestamp
options of TCP packets related to the local machine should be changed
to a new frequency. Its argument is the new frequency to use. (if it
is null or equal to the base frequency it is ignored).
<P>
<H3>TCP decoying Parameters</H3>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>These parameters are grouped together in a block named
<EM>tcp_decoy</EM>.
Example:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
  tcp_decoy {
    code {
      &lt;code...>
    }
  }
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>This block only contains a <EM>code</EM> subsection like the
previous one, that defines tests to perform on packets in order to
recognize pathological packets from analysis tools and decide the way
to handle them. The language used is the same as before (see below).
<P>
<H3>UDP Decoying Parameters</H3>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>These parameters are grouped together in a block named
<EM>udp_unreach</EM>.
Example:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
  udp_unreach {
    reply yes;
    df no;
    max-len 56;
    tos 0;

      udp-data same;
    }
  }
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>The <EM>reply</EM> parameter sets if you want an ICMP "port
unreachable" message to be sent when receiving an UDP datagram for a
port not listening. It can be set to either <EM>yes</EM> or
<EM>no</EM>. The other parametres of this block only apply if this is enabled.
<P>
<P>
<P>The <EM>df</EM> parameters specifies whether the "Don't Fragment"
bit should be set on generated ICMP messages.
<P>
<P>
<P>The <EM>max-len</EM> parameter specifies the maximum length of the
generated ICMP messages.
<P>
<P>
<P>The <EM>tos</EM> parameters specifies the value for the "Type Of
service" field of the IP header of the generated ICMP messages.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>When sending an ICMP "port unreachable" message, part of the
original packet is sent back along. The <EM>mangle-original</EM>
subsection specify how this part should be handled and mangled. The
following parameters are available:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><EM>ip-len {same|&lt;number&gt;}</EM>




: sets the changes to apply to the length field of the original
packet IP header. It can be set to <EM>same</EM> (in that case it is
unchanged) or to any numeric value (in that case it is replaced).</LI>
<LI><EM>ip-id {same|mangle|zero}</EM>





: sets the changes to apply to the id field of the original
packet IP header. It can be set to <EM>same</EM>, <EM>zero</EM> (then it is
set to zero), <EM>mangle</EM> (it is changed for a different value).
</LI>
<LI><EM>ip-csum {same|mangle|zero}</EM>

packet IP header. It can be set to <EM>same</EM>, <EM>zero</EM>, <EM>mangle</EM>.
</LI>
<LI><EM>udp-len {same|&lt;number&gt;}</EM>

packet UDP header. It can be set to <EM>same</EM> or to any numeric value.
</LI>
<LI><EM>udp-csum {same|mangle|zero}</EM>

<P>
<P>
<P>The <EM>tcp_options</EM> and <EM>tcp_decoy</EM>
blocks both have a <EM>code</EM> subsection that can contain a
program. As seen previously, this program is compiled by the dynamic
library extending <EM>iptables</EM> into pseudo-code that is
interpreted in the kernel module by a simple virtual machine. It
operates over a TCP packet and handles an internal state, composed of
the following:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>A TCP options buffer</LI>
<LI>

Several "registers": <EM>flags</EM>, <EM>mss</EM>, <EM>wscale</EM>,
<EM>win</EM>, <EM>ack</EM> and <EM>df</EM> corresponding to the TCP
header fields of the same name for a potential reply packet.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>Code from the <EM>tcp_options</EM> subsection is applied to
an incoming TCP packet, and after running the program the options
buffer from the virtual machine state is used as the new options
buffer for that packet.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>Code from the <EM>tcp_decoy</EM> section is also applied to
an incoming TCP packet, but the packet is not modifed. Depending on
the result of running the program a new packet can be built
from the state of the virtual machine and sent to the source of the
original packet. The original packet can also be dropped, or passed as
is to the next rules.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>These programs are written in a language close to C. Some
conditionnal tests can be performed on the original packets in order
to adjust behavior depending on its contents/status
<P>
<P>A test looks like:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
  if (test) {
    &lt;action>
  }
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

or
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
  if (test) {
    &lt;action>
  } else {
    &lt;action>
  }
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>A test is composed of one or more conditions, separated by
logical operators &amp;&amp; and ||, and grouped together with
parentheses where needed. The following conditions are available:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><EM>option(opt)</EM>


: True if option <EM>opt</EM> is found in the original packet.</LI>
<LI><EM>flags(flag)</EM>


: True if <EM>flag</EM> is enabled in the TCP header flags.</LI>
<LI><EM>flags(flag1&amp;flag2&amp;...)</EM>


: True if all the specified flags are enabled in the TCP header flags.</LI>
<LI><EM>flags(flag1|flag2|...)</EM>


: True if at least one of the specified flags is enabled in the
TCP header flags.</LI>
<LI><EM>ack(val)</EM>


: True if the TCP header ACK field has the value <EM>val</EM>.</LI>
<LI><EM>listen</EM>


: True if the destination port is listening on the local host.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>
<P>The language has several instructions to handle the internal state
of the virtual machine:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><EM>copy(opt)</EM>




: This copies the <EM>opt</EM> option from the original packet
to the options buffer of the state of the virtual machine,
if such an option is found in the original packet.</LI>
<LI><EM>insert(opt, val)</EM>








This inserts the <EM>opt</EM> option in the options buffer,
with the specified value. A numeric value can be passed, or an
expression like <EM>this + &lt;number&gt;</EM> which will give the
option its original value incremented of the specified value. Only the
<EM>mss</EM>, <EM>wscale</EM> and <EM>timestamp</EM> (in that case
"this" means the current value usable as a local timestamp) options
are supported by this instruction.</LI>
<LI><EM>insert(opt)</EM>

: same as <EM>insert(opt, this)</EM>.</LI>
<LI><EM>set(arg, val)</EM>











: This sets one of the internal registers of the virtual machine. The
available registers are <EM>flags</EM>, <EM>df</EM>, <EM>win</EM> and
<EM>ack</EM>. For <EM>flags</EM>, the argument must be a valid
combination of TCP flags, like for the tests. The <EM>df</EM> and
<EM>win</EM> registers can have their value defined relatively to the
original packet value by using the <EM>this + &lt;number&gt;</EM>
construct seen above. This is also available for the <EM>ack</EM>
register but then the final value is relative to the original packet
sequence number (and not to its <EM>ack</EM> value).</LI>
<LI>




<EM>drop</EM>, <EM>accept</EM>, and <EM>reply</EM>: These
instructions stop execution of the program by respectively dropping
the packet, let it pass it to next rule, and build an answer from the
virtual machine state and send it back. The default action is
<EM>accept</EM> at the end of the code.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>Hence, such a language allows one to precisely define behavior to
reorder options, and also to generate appropriate replies for
pathological tests from network analysis tools.
<P>
<P>But we can notice the following points:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>




Since the code in the <EM>tcp_option</EM> subsection only
applies to options reordering, only the options buffer from the state
of the virtual machine is used after running the program. Hence the
<EM>listen</EM> and <EM>ack</EM> tests, and the <EM>insert</EM>, <EM>set</EM>, <EM>drop</EM>,
<EM>reply</EM> instructions have little interest in this case.</LI>
<LI>


The options supported by the different tests and conditions were
extracted from various RFCs specifiyng them; here are the names of the
supported ones:
<EM>eol</EM>, <EM>nop</EM>, <EM>mss</EM>, <EM>wscale</EM>,
<EM>sackOK</EM>, <EM>sack</EM>, <EM>echo</EM>, <EM>echoreply</EM>,

<EM>CC.NEW</EM>, <EM>CC.ECHO</EM>, <EM>acreq</EM>, <EM>acdata</EM>.</LI>
