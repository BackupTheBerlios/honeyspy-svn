<P>Except for the regular behavior specified in RFCs, every IP stack
has some specific ways (due to coding policies, bugs, optimizations...)
of responding to incoming traffic, especially when handling abnormal
packets that do not strictly follow the RFC.
<P>These specificities are used by network analysis software to guess
what OS a remote host is running. They probe the OS by sending the
host a bunch of abnormal packets (mangling parametres such as
fragmentation, TCP flags, unused/reserved fields, size of packets,
...) and comparing the results with a signatures database of known
operating systems.
<P>Such tools are used by system administrators to map an heterogenous
network, but also by crackers trying to learn more information about a
remote host or a subnet, in order to use appropriate attacks and
improve their chance of compromising the systems.
<P><EM>IP Personality</EM> is a <EM>netfilter</EM> module designed to be able
to have different 'personalities' network wise, that is to
change some characteristics of the network traffic, depending on
different parameters. This especially enables fooling such tools in
thinking a remote host is running a specific system when it is
actually running another one, so as to hide or protect hosts that
would otherwise vulnerable, or to build "honey pots".
